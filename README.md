# 🔐 Password Strength Indicator

A simple and elegant **Password Strength Indicator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It visually displays how strong or weak your password is based on its length. The design is minimal, clean, and fully responsive — a great mini-project for beginners learning DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **HTML5** | Structure of the web page |
| **CSS3** | Styling and layout |
| **JavaScript (Vanilla)** | Logic for password strength calculation |

## 🧭 How It Works
1. The user types a password.  
2. JavaScript listens for every keystroke using the `input` event.  
3. Based on the password length:
   - `< 4` characters → **Weak (Red)**  
   - `4–7` characters → **Medium (Orange)**  
   - `≥ 8` characters → **Strong (Green)**  
4. Border and text color update dynamically to show password strength.
